# Arc'teryx Navbar with Search

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lsAeMj3YLei0QnuqQY/giphy.gif"/>

> With this application we've created a clone of the 
Arc'teryx product page. Our goal was to mimic the look
and feel of the website while improving it's function
where we saw fit. This repo is a recreation of the 
Navbar and it's search component. The navbar is rendered through 
React and features animations all done through basic CSS transitions,
and some state tracking and event listeners through React as well.
The search component is more akin to an entire fully featured search
page than it is a standard search bar. All of the filtering
is done via Javascript and the items and filters
are styled via flexbox and conditionally rendered based on
their state in React.
